# GuavaLetters
###A fun word game

##Setup
* Clone this repository
* Make sure you have NodeJS, NPM, Gulp and Bower installed
* Navigate to the project direcctory in command line.
* Run 'npm install && bower install && gulp gulp build && gulp serve' in command line.

##Directions
'Banangrams' style web-based word game created with Javascript, jQuery, HTML and CSS. The player is dealt 30 letter tiles and must construct a scrabble-like array of connected words and then submit their board for authentication before the time limit runs out. The program then checks if all words are connected, all letters are used and all submitted words are real English words (via the SOWPODS dictionary API). 

##Known issues
The gh-pages version of the app will not run our internal API. The local version runs fine.   We are looking into other hosting options.
